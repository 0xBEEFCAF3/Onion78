# Chaincase.GTK

The GTK supported version
This is experimental software. Use at your discretion.

Right now Chaincase.GTK boots and crashes on macOS, but that is likely because of a pre-existing tor setup and the GTK is trying to install.

AFAIK, the CustomBuildActions does not properly copy the folder so TorDamons and OnionSeeds must both manually be placed in Chaincase.GTK/bin/Debug/
